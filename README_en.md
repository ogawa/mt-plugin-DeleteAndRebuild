   * Initial release.

## Overview

Basically, Movable Type does not rebuild any archives when you delete an entry, therefore, you need to rebuild all archives manually in order to keep archives consistent with the database.

To solve this problem, DeleteAndRebuild Plugin automatically rebuilds archives which are (thought to be) related to deleted entries.
